Prologue
Argh... I can't take this anymore
*Press Extract Memory*

Intro
AI: Hello MC,
You have extracted your memories into this game
.... (explanation already in game)
You can re-experience your memories by gathering the memory fragments that are spread throughout the levels.
Good Luck!
=== after merging===
@, Welcome to the Tower of Babel.
I am XJ-9 and I will be introducing this world to you.
Firstly, you are allowed to place blocks of ice with the 'F' key.
You are also able to throw balls of ice with the 'R' key, which creates a block of ice if it lands on the ground.
Use the WASD keys to move and the Space key to jump.
Press the 'C' key to crouch, and the Left Control key to duck.
Lastly, press the Left Shift key to sprint.
Your memories have been lost in this world.
Should you manage to conquer this world, your memories will be returned to you.
Good luck!
