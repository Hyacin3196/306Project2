@, Welcome to the Tower of Babel.
I am XJ-9 and I will be introducing this world to you.
Firstly, you are allowed to place blocks of ice with the 'F' key.
You are also able to throw balls of ice with the 'R' key, which creates a block of ice if it lands on the ground.
Use the WASD keys to move and the Space button to jump.
Press the 'C' key to crouch, and the Left Control button to duck.
Lastly, press the Left Shift button to sprint.
You have decided to extract your own memories into this game.
If you are able to conquer this world, your lost memories will be returned to you.
Good luck!
